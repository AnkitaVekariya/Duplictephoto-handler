# Duplicate Photo Handler

ðŸš€ **Duplicate Photo Handler** is a Java application designed to help you manage and clean up duplicate photos in your folders. Using a HashSet data structure, this tool efficiently identifies duplicate images and organizes them into a designated folder.

## Features

- **Efficient Duplicate Detection**: Utilizes a HashSet to quickly identify duplicate photos.
- **Progress Updates**: Displays progress updates after processing every 100 photos.
- **Organized Cleanup**: Moves duplicate photos to a "DuplicatePhotos" folder for easy management.
- **User-Friendly Output**: Prints a message if no duplicates are found.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Provide the path to the folder you want to clean up.
2. **Processing**: The application scans the folder, processes the photos, and identifies duplicates.
3. **Output**: Duplicate photos are moved to the "DuplicatePhotos" folder, and progress updates are displayed throughout the process.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/DuplicatePhotoHandler.git

## Usage

3. When prompted, enter the path to the folder you wish to clean:
